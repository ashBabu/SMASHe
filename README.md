# model_predictive_control
Model predictive control of serial robots 
### Aim
* learn symbolic python and use either Newton-Euler recursive relations or Lagrange's method to compute mass, M(q), coriolis and centripetal, C(q, dq) and Gravity, G(q)
* URDF parsing
* Craig's DH convention to define transformations
* Compare control with Data driven approach like reinforcement learning
* Model predictive control for path planning
* Study the motion of base and replanning to reach a target
